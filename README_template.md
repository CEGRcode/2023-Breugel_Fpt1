## Abstract
Transfer RNA genes (tDNAs) are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes ranging from mRNA translation to genome organization and disease. Transcription of tDNAs by RNAPIII is tightly regulated upon nutrient and stress signaling. However, the emerging notion that tDNAs across the genome are differentially regulated suggests that chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms are at play. To identify such mechanisms, we used Epi-Decoder to decode the chromatin proteome of a single native tDNA locus in the yeast genome by DNA-sequencing. The tDNA proteome, including the core RNAPIII transcription machinery, showed dynamic reprogramming upon conditions of nutrient stress. Among the factors that dynamically occupy the tDNA proteome we identified Ykr011c (referred to as Fpt1), a protein of unknown function. Fpt1 uniquely binds tRNA genes but occupancy at tRNA genes was variable and correlated with RNAPIII responsiveness. Decoding the tDNA proteome in the absence of Fpt1 revealed a role in the eviction of RNAPIII during conditions of repressed transcription. While Fpt1 exclusively occupied RNAPIII regulated genes, cells without Fpt1 also showed impaired shutdown of RNAPII transcribed ribosome biogenesis genes in changing nutrient conditions. Together, a DNA-sequencing based locus-specific proteome atlas revealed dynamic binding of known and unknown factors in the tDNA proteome. Our findings provide support for a chromatin-based regulatory mechanism of RNAPIII assembly that also tunes an integrated physiological response to changing metabolic conditions.
